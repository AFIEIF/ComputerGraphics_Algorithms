<h1>Computer Graphics Algorithms
  <h2>These programs show the step by step calculation of coordinates for various Computer Graphic Algorithms</h2> 
  <p> I often get assignments which require us to manually calculate the coordinates at each step , I personally found it very tiring and made these programs to do the work for me and display all the values in a tabular form</p>
